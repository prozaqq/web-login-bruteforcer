# web-login-bruteforcer
This is a working example for a multi-threaded website login bruteforcer . 
It was designed to bruteforce a specific website and wont work on any other website without changing specific parameters , but the bruteforce logic stays the same .

<b>Todo:</b>
- Add logic to an empty proxy queue
- Add verbose mode of unsuccessful login attempts (both proxy errors and bad user/pass bombo)
- Reformat ugly code
